### Project Overview

#### Purpose and Expectations
We have designed a big durable amphibious goose remover badger
#
For the PGA golf course that spends $250k a year on goose removal and maintenance. 
Our amphibious badger is able to photograph and detect geese and chase them away. 
In addition to that the badger has GPS patrol path with collision avoidance and neural network image recognition.
#
Our badger helps drive out the geese that interfere with the business in a low maintenance and cost-effective manner instead of the old fashion way of shooting them.
