### Project Purpose and Expectations
We propose a driving robot optimized for golf courses that use image recognition and self-driving technology.
What's noteworthy in this paper is that we used Vitis AI, which Xilinx developed for all developers, to recognize images.
Self-driving robots that track geese are equipped with automatic monitoring functions as they go around golf courses.
The concept of our project is that several robots send and receive data from each other, recognize and track geese, and chase them away that cause damage to commercial areas. When robots recognize geese, they accumulate geese photo data and provide it to the lab, enabling efficient use in the area of animal behabior modification and Pest control Industry.

### Our Robot

#### Originality and Differentiation
We have designed a big durable amphibious goose remover badger
For the PGA golf course that spends $250k a year on goose removal and maintenance. 
Our amphibious badger is able to photograph and detect geese and chase them away. 
In addition to that the badger has GPS patrol path with collision avoidance and neural network image recognition.
Our badger helps drive out the geese that interfere with the business in a low maintenance and cost-effective manner instead of the old fashion way of shooting them.


#### Technical Development
1. Easy to Drive  
2. Neural Network Image Recognition    
3. Amphibious    
4. Autonomous

### Badger Robot (BADGR)
The robot is designed for manufacturable, advanced prototype of the autonomous and amphibious goose chasing system, called the BADGR, which was prototyped in 2018. This system must meet the constraints outlined below and also be designed to be easily reproducible to meet the manufacturable specification. 
Requirement / Constraint and Description
1) Goose Detection: BADGR must be able to identify Canadian Geese with a camera
2) Amphibious Design: BADGR must be able to float and maneuver well in water
3) GPS Navigation: BADGR must be able to accurately navigate a path with GPS
4) Cloud Connectivity: BADGR must be able to upload all goose images to be shared with A&K	
5) Autonomous Design: BADGR must be able to be set up once and operate without further human interaction

The system will also have a base station, called the BADGR Den, which will be the housing station for the BADGR when it is not in use. This will have GPS and Radio communication with the BADGR and also allow for uploading geese images to the cloud. This is the extent of the scope of our project. It has been set based on a careful review of last year’s project in unison with communication with our sponsor about what they want in an upgraded version of the BADGR.

##### Comparing goose detection(original model vs sample model)      
<img width="178" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68213891/101438747-65a1b800-3956-11eb-8692-d8af0b869d97.png">
    
The original detection FPS are less than 4.5 but accuracy is more than 96.3%.
When we used ZCU104 board with yolov3 model to test, the models show good FPS near the performance FPS measured before. But when test 50 images with yolov3 vcc model, it showed bad result. Almost images are recognized as bird, but the accuracy are very low(average: 54.6%, standard variation: 44.71%). It is expected that the advantages of both cases can be used at the same time if the model is made and used by focusing more on Goose.
